Automatically setup a dev environment

# Components
 - Chocolatey Install
 - Preset junction binding

# Configuration
There are 3 sections to the configuration file.  The first is global configuration items.  This includes a dropbox path. 

The second area for configuration is packages for chocolatey to install.

The third area for configuration is links to create.  Links can be junction, hard-link, symbolic-link or copy.  (Copying is technically not a link at all, clearly)
